# ONC_Autonomous_Robot

This repository showcases the code used for a school project in first year engineering at University of Victoria.

##Background
Ocean Networks Canada is a UVic research initiative that uses deep-sea sensors to monitor chemical and biological conditions on the ocean floor. Due to the depth of the sensors, it is necessary for them to be cabled for adequate power and data-retrieval. Unfortunately, cables deteriorate in deep-sea environments and need to be replaced.

Due to the high cost and danger of sending human divers down to recable the sensors, it would be preferable if there was a robot which could navigate the ocean floor to find the sensors and attach new cables. This is where we came in. Our class was divided into groups of 3-4 and tasked with creating prototypes for an autonomous cabling robots using VEX Cortex robotics kits. I was lucky enough to have a few mech students in my group that were more than happy to let me take care of all the coding.

We were strongly encouraged to use a switch-case implementation and develop a finite state machine to guide our robot's actions.
